# The-Man
linkedin bot


## Feats
- posting shit
- following popular mfs
- sending connections to random mfs
- reacting to posts


## Welp
- welp i got detected, and they want some id bs, its to be expected tbh so moving on


## Overall
it was not hard to automate some linkden actions, with more careful testing and dedication i think its more than possible to automate it 100% and create a normal linkden user aka a bot (jk)
